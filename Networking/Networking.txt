										NETWORKING
									------------------------


* Computer -> commonly oriented machince particularly used for education and training, education and research.
* Network -> computers connected together
* Internet -> collection of computer networks.
* WWW -> information system that has access to any documents or resources that are identified by uniform resource locators(url).

									ISP (internet service provider)
											|
										   Modem/Router
											|
									----------------------------------
									|		|		 |
								     Device-1        Device-2        Device-3

* this isp has global ip address.
* all device connected to this modem has same IP address
* the ip address of the devices are known as local ip addresses.
* Modem assigns IP addresses ussing the DHCP(Dynamic host configuration protocol)
* any device send request like google.com to modem, it sends to isp. Later, google send response to isp and it returns the response to the router, and it decides who had the request using NAT(Network access translator)
* IP address decides which device to send the data, but the application to send the data of the device is done through PORTS(Port numbers)
* When two friends are communicating via internet, IP  address decides where computers are located, and port numbers denoting which application used to communicate. 
* Ports -> 16 bit numbers (16 cells, where every cell contains 0/1)
* total port numbers possible are -> 2^16 (65000)
* HTTP -> port 80
* ports from 0 -1023 -> reserved ports
* ports 1024 - 49152 -> specified applications
* remaining -> we can use
* tier-1 ISP - TATA
* nodes -> Any communicating device in a network is called a Node. Node is the point of intersection in a network. It can send/receive data and information within a network. Examples of the node can be computers, laptops, printers, servers, modems, etc.
* links ->  A link or edge refers to the connectivity between two nodes in the network. It includes the type of connectivity (wired or wireless) between the nodes and protocols used for one node to be able to communicate with the other.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PACKETS : 
---------
* A packet is a unit of data transmitted over a network.
* It contains both the data being transferred and the necessary control information, such as source and destination addresses.
* packet include the header, payload, and sometimes a trailer. The heade->source and destination addresses, payload->actual data being transmitted.
* packets are routed using the ip adress that are done by router through the decisions made by the routng table.
* packets can be lost or corrupted, this can be addressed by error detection, checksum.
* packets-ip and mframes - mac	

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


PROTOCOLS : (rules setup by someone, how a particular data to be sent)
------------
* HTTP(hyper text transfer protocol)
	-> used by web browsers like www
	-> defines how data and it's format to be transfered,client-server protocol that tells how request, response sent and recieved
	-> stateless protocol. 
	-> Methods : GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
	-> built on tcp
	-> port 80
* HTTPS(hyper text transfer protocol secure)
	-> advanced and secure version of http
	-> on top of http, ssl/tls is used.
	-> secure communication
	-> encrypts data using TLS(transport layer security) or SSL(secure socket layer)
	-> protects from eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attack
	-> port 443
* TLS(transport layer security)
	-> cryptographic protocol for securre transmission of data
	-> successor to ssl
* SSL(secure socket layer)
	-> earliest cryptographic protocol used
	-> developed by NETSCAPE in mid 1900
* DHCP(dynamic host configuration protocol) 
	-> auto-configure devices on IP networks enabling them to use the TCP and UDP-based protocols.
	-> It helps to get the subnet mask, IP address and helps to resolve the DNS.
	-> it eliminates need of manual IP address configuration, reduces risk of address conflicts.
	-> port 67
* FTP(file transfer protocol) 
	-> appplication layer protocol
	-> It can also be used to download files from remote servers to your computer.
	-> to transfer files between client and server on a computer network.
	-> ftp transmits data including username, password, in plain text which case pose security issues unless sent by secure protocol ftps 
	-> port 27
* TFTP(trivial file transfer protocol) 
	-> simple and lightweight ftp for transferrring files between network devices.
	-> operates at application layer and used in scenarios where more feature-rich protocol like ftp is not required.
	-> used for bootstrapping devices for boot process.
	-> often used in embedded systems, network appliances and firmware updates where its is sufficient.
* SMTP(simple mail transfer protocols) 
	-> to transfer mails between server on internet
	-> SMTP sets the rule for communication between servers. 
	-> text base protocol that uses commands and responses to transfer. This set of rules helps the software to transmit emails over the internet.
	-> port 25
* POP3(post office protocol) 
	-> protocol used by clients to revieve email from a mail server over TCP/IP connection.
* IMAP(intenet message access protocol) 
	-> accessing and managing emails stored in remote servers, from mutiple devices or locations
	-> flexible
* SSH(secure shell) 
	-> cryptographic network protocol used for secure communication and remote access to devices over unsecured network.
	-> provides strong encryption, authentication, and integrity protection
* TCP(transmission control protocol) :
	-> it is a set of rules that decides how a computer connects to the Internet and how to transmit the data over the network. 
	-> It creates a virtual network when more than one computer is connected to the network and uses the three ways handshake model to establish the connection which makes it more 	reliable.
	-> tcp segmnts data recieved from application layer.
	-> also collect data from network layer.
	-> congestion control, error control.
	-> maintains order of data using sequence numbers.
	-> connection oriented, full-duplex(simultaneous transfer of files).
* UDP(user datagram protocol) :
	-> Mainly, it is used for multicasting and broadcasting. 
	-> Its functionality is almost the same as TCP/IP Protocol except for the three ways of handshaking and error checking. 
	-> It uses a simple transmission without any hand-shaking which makes it less reliable.
	-> data may/maynot be delivered, connectionless protocol.
	-> udp packet's header consists of source,destnation port no(4bytes), length od datagram(2 bytes), checksum(2 bytes), total size of data is 2^16-8.

* TCP VS UDP : 
	-> connection oriented, no connnection oriented
	-> more reliable, less reliable
	-> slower transmission, fast transmission
	-> packets can be preserved  or rearranged, packets order is not fixed
	-> uses 3 way handshake for connection , not use
	-> packets are heavy0wweight, less weight
	-> offers error checking mechanism, no error checking
	-> used by (http,https,smtp), used by (dns,tftp)
* PPP(point-to-point) 
	-> establishing a direct connection between two nodes in a network
	-> through telephone lines or serial cables
* ARP(address resolution protocol)
	-> network level protocol
	-> protocol used to map an ip address to mac address in local network	
	-> It can also be used to get the MAC address of devices when they are trying to communicate over the local network.
	-> It is essential for the proper functioning of protocols like Ethernet and IPv4 in local area networks (LANs).
* ICMP(internet control message access protocol)
	-> network layer protocol used for error handling
	-> used by routers for diagnsoing network connecting issues
	-> used for sending erroe messages and operational infromation betweend devices in an IP network.
	-> essential for troubleshooting, monitoring and error handling
	-> provies feedback about network conditions and facilitates reliable delivery of IP packets within networks.
	-> port 7
* DNS(domain name system) :
	-> translate human-friendly domain names to numerical IP addresses (such as 192.0.2.1) that computers use to identify each other on the network.
	-> when we type www.google.com, http protocol take that url and find the IP address of goofle through DNS.
	-> mail.google.com. here, mail -> sub-domain, google -> second-level domain, .com -> top level domain
	-> top level domains -> .com, .io, .org, .edu

* 3-WAY HANDSHAKE PROTOCOL :
	-> client send (SYN) and (SEQ.NO) and to server. ---> send syn
	-> server send (ACK), (SEQ.NO) and (ACK.NO) to client. here, ack.no = (seq.no + 1) --- send syn+ack
	-> client send (ACK), (SEQ.NO) and (ACK.NO) again to server.--- send ack

* IP ADDRESS :
	-> every single device in internet to talk to each other they have ip adress.
	-> format is X.X.X.X ->every single x has value range from 0-255
	-> for example in 192.168.3.130. here, first 3 are network address/subnet id and the last one is device address/host id. 
	-> subnetting -> blocks of IP addresses are assigned to the ISP
	-> Classes : 
		* A = 0.0.0.0   - 127.255.255.255
		* B = 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255
		* C = 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255
		* D = 224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255
		* E = 240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 
	-> IPV4 -> 32 bit, 4 octets each 8 bits.
		
		* PRIVATE ADDRESS :

		IPv4 Class	Private IPv4 Start Address	Private IPv4 End Address
		    A			10.0.0.0		   10.255.255.255

		* SPECIAL ADDRESS : 127.0.0.1 to 127.255.255.255 are network testing addresses also known as loopback addresses are the special IP address.
		
	-> IPV6 -> 128 bits,8 words all are hexadecimal .Not backward compatible, IPS's would have to shift and lot of hardware works.

* IPV4 VS IPV6 :  
	-> length : 32bits, 128 bits
	-> representsation : dotted with 4 decimal numbers, colons with 4 hexadecimal 
	-> running out due to rapid growth of internet, developed by providing vast space
	-> header : 20bytes, 40 bytes
	-> quality of support : limited, more
	-> security : lack, secure
	-> deployment : dominant and widely used, slower but rapdily increasing.

* MAC ADDRESS (media access control) :
	-> It is a 48-bit or 64-bit unique identifier of devices in the network. 
	-> It is also called the physical address embedded with Network Interface Card (NIC) 
	-> It refers to a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
	-> allow devices to identify and communicate with each other within a local network.

* MAC VS IP :
	-> 6 or 8 byte hexadecimal, 4 or 16 byte
	-> retrieved by ARP , retrieved by RARP
	-> NIC provides MAC address, ISP provides IP address
	-> ensure physical address of computer, ensure logical address of computer
	-> operates in datalink layer, operates in network layer
	-> used to identify device, ued to identify connection of device on network.
	-> cannot be changed, can be changed
	-> can't be easily found by third-party,can be easily found by third-party 
	-> no classes, 5 classes

* Troubleshooting -> process of identifying, diagnosing, and resolving problems or issues within a system, network, device, or process.

STATUS CODES :
---------------
* 1XX -> Informational category
* 2XX -> Success 
* 3XX -> Re-direction
* 4XX -> Client Error
* 5XX -> Server Error

COOKIES :
--------
* unique string.
* stored in client browser, when a website is visited.
* whenever new request sent in HTTP, the header contains cookies and server comes to know who is contacting.
* third-party cookies -> cookies that are set for the URL's that we do not vists.

SUBNET :
--------
* A subnet is a network inside a network achieved by the process called subnetting which helps divide a network into subnets.
* It is used for getting a higher routing efficiency and enhances the security of the network. 
* It reduces the time to extract the host address from the routing table.

SUB-NET MASKING :
-----------------
* a subnet mask is a number that resembles an IP address and it reveals how many bits in the IP address are used for network by masking the network portion of IP address.
* convert it into binary number.
* 1's in the subnet mask indicates the network address and 0's indicate host address. 

	00110101 11100010 00000001 00000000
	11111111 11111111 00000000 00000000

	first 2 - network, last 2 - host. since , it matches all one

* CLASS		FIRST OCTET ADDRESS	DEFAULT SUBNET MASK
    A		      1 - 127	             255.0.0.0
    B		     128 - 191	            255.255.0.0
    B		     192 - 223	           255.255.255.0

* CIDR(classless inter-domain routing) / slash notation -> 192.168.1.0/24 means this ip has 24 1's in it.



Q.)Why IP address has network and host part ?
	-> manageability, to break down larger network to smaller networks or subnetworks, which is called as subnetting


What happens when you enter google.com in the web browser :
-------------------------------------------------------------
* Check the browser cache first if the content is fresh and present in cache display the same.
* If not, the browser checks if the IP of the URL is present in the cache (browser and OS) if not then request the OS to do a DNS lookup using UDP to get the corresponding IP address of               
  the URL from the DNS server to establish a new TCP connection.
* A new TCP connection is set between the browser and the server using three-way handshaking.
* An HTTP request is sent to the server using the TCP connection.
* The web servers running on the Servers handle the incoming HTTP request and send the HTTP response.
* The browser process the HTTP response sent by the server and may close the TCP connection or reuse the same for future requests.
* If the response data is cacheable then browsers cache the same.
* Browser decodes the response and renders the content.

* Broadcast is when computersends out data to all computers on a network , so it can locate and talk to certain computers.
* problem is it make all computers to broadcast and it become slow down network and cause broadcast traffic.
* to prvent this network should be broken down using routers. so, broadcast could not go pass the routers , they stay within it.
* if differenct computer wants to connect, then connection flow from computer-gateway-router-router-gateway-computer

HUB VS SWITCH :
---------------
* operates at physical layer, data link layer
* half-duplex transmission mode, full-duplex transmiison

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIREWALL :
----------
* The firewall is a network security system that is used to monitor the incoming and outgoing traffic and blocks the same based on the firewall security policies.
* It acts as a wall between the internet (public network) and the networking devices (a private network).
* It is either a hardware device, software program, or a combination of both. It adds a layer of security to the network.
* Before Firewalls, network security was performed by Access Control Lists (ACLs) residing on routers.
* ACLs are rules that determine whether network access should be granted or denied to specific IP address.
* But ACLs cannot determine the nature of the packet it is blocking. Also, ACL alone does not have the capacity to keep threats out of the network.
* Hence, the Firewall was introduced. Firewall match the network traffic against the rule set defined in its table.
	-> first gen - packet filtering firewall
	-> second gen - stateful inspection firewall
	-> third gen -  Application Layer Firewall 
	-> next generation firewall
