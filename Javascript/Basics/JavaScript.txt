dom -> document object model

~ slice(start,end) -> returns elements in range
~ substring(start, end) -> returns elements in range
~ substr(start, length) -> returns the total length element from start
~ push -> push element at last in array
~ pop -> pop last elements in array
~ shift -> removes first element in array( a place is replaced by b)
~ unshift -> adds new element in front
~ delete -> delete array element and make it as empty element
~ splice(start,no of element to be deleted, untill how many element) -> delete and replace the next element in the previous place
~ splice(1,2,'X','Y') -> replacing the deleted element
~ splice(1,0,'b') -> replacing the element in index 1 without deleting anything
~ array.join() -> every element in array will be string seperated by a comma(,)
~ str.split -> string will be array
~ spread(...arrayName) -> join two diiferent arrays.

~ Map function (x => x.age) -> will create new array and store elements
~ filter -> returns new array by checking each value of originial array using call back fn
~ reduce -> reduce the element size arr.reduce(total,el)
~ flat() -> reduces 2D array to 1D array

~ async -> simultaneous operatons, sync -> line by line execution
~ promise ->deterining success or failure of an asyncchronous operation -> promise(resolve,reject)--------------(.then),(.catch)

~ async function return promise and should contain await keywrd -> block the execution of other elements and wait untill the current element execution overed
